## Introduction
Welcome to the **Coding Course Roadmap**. This course provides a structured guide for learning software development, progressing from foundational skills to advanced topics.

## Course Overview
This course is designed to take complete beginners through to advanced levels in software development. It covers basic web development, full-stack development, building APIs, testing, deployment, and advanced data structures and algorithms. You'll also gain experience with industry-relevant tools and frameworks.

## Course Outline
The course is structured into three main tracks, depending on your current skill level:

### 1. Complete Beginners
- **Introduction**
- **Version Control** (e.g., Git)
- **Basics of Programming** (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Programming Fundamentals** (syntax, control flow, loops)

### 2. Intermediate
- **Full Stack Development**
- **APIs & Fetching Data**
- **Testing & Debugging**
- **Logical Thinking & Problem-Solving**

### 3. Advanced
- **Building Skills** (Advanced projects)
- **Soft Skills** (communication, teamwork)
- **Project Deployment** (CI/CD, DevOps practices)
- **Industry Norms and Best Practices**

Additionally, you will dive into specific **Languages and Frameworks**:
- **Basic Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Advanced Web Development**: React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Firebase
- **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)**: Python, C++, Pandas, Matplotlib, Dynamic Programming, Competitive Programming

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will:
- Master the basics of web development and full-stack programming.
- Build and deploy full-stack applications using modern frameworks.
- Understand data structures, algorithms, and their applications in problem-solving.
- Use industry-standard tools for version control, testing, and deployment.
- Apply logical thinking and best coding practices to build professional-grade projects.

## Prerequisites
- **Complete Beginners**: No prior programming knowledge is required.
- **Intermediate and Advanced**: Basic understanding of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is recommended.

## Target Audience
- **Beginners** who want to start a career in web development.
- **Intermediate learners** who want to build full-stack applications.
- **Advanced developers** looking to strengthen their DSA and competitive programming skills.

## Course Format
The course is a combination of:
- **Lectures** to introduce concepts.
- **Hands-on coding** sessions and assignments.
- **Quizzes and assessments** to track progress.
- **Project-based learning** to apply knowledge.

## Course Schedule
This course will be organized as follows:

- **Week 1-4**: Basics and Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Week 5-8**: Full Stack Development (APIs, React, Node.js)
- **Week 9-12**: Advanced Concepts (DSA, Frameworks, Project Deployment)

## Assessment and Evaluation
Students will be evaluated based on:
- **Quizzes** after each module.
- **Coding assignments** and projects.
- **Final project** showcasing full-stack development and deployment skills.

## Course Resources
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub.
- **Online IDEs**: Replit, CodePen.
- **Documentation**: MDN Web Docs, React documentation, Node.js documentation.
- **Books and Tutorials**: Provided during the course.
